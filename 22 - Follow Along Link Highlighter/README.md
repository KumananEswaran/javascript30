This project creates a navigation menu where a highlight effect follows the links when hovered over. When a user hovers over any link, a span element with a highlight class appears under the link and adjusts its position and size according to the link's dimensions. I learned how to track the position and size of elements using getBoundingClientRect(), dynamically create and style elements, and use mouse events like mouseenter to trigger animations or changes on the page.
