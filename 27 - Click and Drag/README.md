This project creates a horizontal scrolling feature using mouse drag. When you click and drag inside the .items container, the content scrolls left or right. JavaScript tracks the mouse position and calculates how much to scroll based on movement. The mousedown, mouseup, and mouseleave events control when dragging starts and stops, while mousemove updates the scroll position smoothly.
