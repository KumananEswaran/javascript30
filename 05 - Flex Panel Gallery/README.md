This "Flex Panels" project creates an interactive layout where panels expand with smooth animations when clicked, revealing additional text. Using JavaScript, I learned to add interactivity by employing addEventListener for click and transition events. The toggleOpen function dynamically toggles the open class to expand panels, while the toggleActive function listens for transitionend events to handle animations tied to the flex property.
