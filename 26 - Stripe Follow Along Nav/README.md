This project creates a navigation menu with dropdowns that appear when you hover over the links. The background of the dropdown adjusts its size and position to match the hovered item. Smooth animations are added using CSS and JavaScript. The JavaScript handles mouse events to show and hide the dropdowns while updating the background position dynamically.
