This project sorts a list of band names while ignoring common articles like "A," "An," and "The." The strip function removes these words from the beginning of each name before sorting. The sort method then arranges the names alphabetically based on the modified versions. Finally, the sorted list is displayed in an HTML ul. I learned how to remove specific words from strings, sort an array with a custom function, and dynamically update the DOM using JavaScript.
