This project creates a text-to-speech app where users can type text and hear it spoken aloud. They can choose different voices, adjust the speech rate and pitch, and control playback with "Speak" and "Stop" buttons. I learned how to use the SpeechSynthesis API to make the browser speak, populate a dropdown with available voices, update speech properties dynamically, and control speech playback by starting and stopping it with speechSynthesis.speak() and speechSynthesis.cancel().
