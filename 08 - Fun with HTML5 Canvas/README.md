This project creates a fun and interactive drawing application using the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The user can draw colorful lines that change color dynamically based on the hue, creating a rainbow effect. The line thickness changes smoothly between a range, adding a unique visual effect. The app responds to mouse movements and clicks to start and stop the drawing.

From this JavaScript project, I learned how to use the Canvas API to draw shapes and lines dynamically. I also understood concepts like event listeners for mouse actions, the HSL color model for dynamic color changes, and how to adjust properties like lineWidth and globalCompositeOperation to create cool effects.
