This project is a secret code detector that listens for key presses and checks if a specific word (like "wesbos") is typed. If the word is entered correctly, it triggers a fun effect using cornify_add(). I learned how to capture keyboard events with keyup, store key presses in an array, limit the array length to match the secret word, and check if the typed sequence matches the code. This helped me understand event listeners, array manipulation, and string comparison.
