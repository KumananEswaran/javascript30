This project is a custom HTML video player with play/pause, volume and speed controls, skip buttons, a progress bar, and a fullscreen toggle. I learned how to control video playback using the play() and pause() methods, update the button icon based on the video state, adjust volume and speed with range inputs, skip forward or backward, and update the progress bar dynamically. I also practiced handling mouse events to scrub through the video and modifying element styles for a fullscreen effect.
