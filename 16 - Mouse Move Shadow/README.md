This project creates a mouse shadow effect where the text shadow moves based on the mouse position. As the user moves the mouse over the screen, the script calculates the mouse position relative to the .hero div and adjusts the text shadow of the h1 element. The shadow changes direction and color dynamically. I learned how to use event listeners for mouse movement, calculate offset positions, and apply dynamic CSS styles using JavaScript.
