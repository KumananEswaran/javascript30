This project is a type-ahead search feature that dynamically displays matching cities or states as you type. It fetches city data from an external JSON file and uses JavaScript to filter the results based on the input. The matches are highlighted and displayed along with the population, formatted with commas for readability. Through this project, I learned how to fetch and handle external data, use RegExp for pattern matching, dynamically update the DOM.
