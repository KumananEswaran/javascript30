This project converts spoken words into text using the browser's Speech Recognition API. It listens to speech, converts it into text, and displays it on the page. If the speech input is final, it starts a new paragraph. The recognition restarts automatically when it ends. I learned how to use SpeechRecognition to capture voice input, convert speech into text, display text dynamically on a webpage, and continuously restart speech recognition.
