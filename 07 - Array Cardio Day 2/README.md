# 04 ARRAY CARDIO DAY 2: <a target="_blank" href="07-array-cardio-day-2.vercel.app">Visit Here</a>

 This project is part of an Array Cardio exercise, focusing on JavaScript array methods.  It demonstrates practical uses of methods like some(), every(), find(), and findIndex() with real-world examples. I learned to efficiently check conditions, find items, and modify arrays using modern JavaScript methods and the spread operator.
