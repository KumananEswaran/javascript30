This project makes the navigation bar stick to the top when the user scrolls past it. It checks the scroll position and adds a fixed position class to the navbar while adjusting the page's padding to prevent layout shifts. I learned how to get element positions using offsetTop, detect scroll events, update styles dynamically, and use classList to add or remove CSS classes.
