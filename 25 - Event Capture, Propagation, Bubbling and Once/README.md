# 25 EVENT CAPTURE, PROPAGATION, BUBBLING AND ONCE

This project logs the class name of a div when clicked and logs "Click!!!" when the button is clicked. The event listeners are set to run only once using { once: true }, so each element responds to clicks only the first time. I learned about event bubbling, how to use e.stopPropagation() to stop events from traveling up, and how the { once: true } option prevents repeated event triggers.
