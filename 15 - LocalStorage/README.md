This project is a local tapas list where users can add food items, mark them as eaten (using checkboxes), and manage the list with buttons to delete all, check all, or uncheck all items. The data is stored in localStorage, so the list stays even after refreshing the page. I learned how to handle form submissions, update the UI dynamically using JavaScript, store data in localStorage, and toggle checkboxes using event listeners.
