This project is a simple to-do list where you can check multiple checkboxes at once by holding the Shift key. When you click one checkbox, hold Shift, and click another, all checkboxes in between get checked automatically. I learned how to handle events like click and detect the Shift key. I also practiced looping through checkboxes, using conditions to track the first and last checked items, and updating their checked state dynamically.
